I am currently a junior at The University of Iowa Tippie College of Business. I am majoring in Business Analytics and Finance.
I had an internship with AbbVie this summer where I was a Marketing Analytics Buisness Intelligence Intern. This was a wonderful opportunity where I was able to utilize and expand my analytical skills.
